                <h5>ESPN Pre-Draft Analysis</h5>
                <p><strong>Strengths</strong></p>
                    <p>- Versatile guard who has the size, strength and length to play either backcourt position. Only 6-3 but has a strong frame and a near 6-8 wingspan. Has a feel for the game that allows him to contribute in a variety of ways. Played mostly off the ball for Kentucky but showed flashes of basic playmaking operating out of pick-and-roll, including the ability to manipulate a ball screen and get to his spots on the floor.</p>
                    <p>- Instinctive scorer who excels in transition and shows the ability to put the ball in the basket from all over the floor. Plays at different speeds and has an advanced floater game for his age. Finishes through contact. Confident shot-maker with range and touch.</p>
                    <p>- Physical player defensively. Uses his strong frame, length and anticipation skills to his advantage. Fearless player with toughness and swagger.</p>
                <p><strong>Improvement areas</strong></p>
                    <p>- Not a freakish athlete from a run/jump standpoint. Doesn't have blazing speed. Game revolves more around changes of speed, strength and pace. Struggles to finish over length at times. Can't always create high percentage shots for himself or others. Made just 49% of his 2-pointers at Kentucky.</p> 
                    <p>- Shot-selection and decision-making are works in progress. Has demonstrated flashes of being able to make others better but was inconsistent in that area. Posted just a 1.4-to-1 assist-to-turnover ratio.</p> 
                    <p>- Makes 3s with some volume, but has been streaky throughout his career. Made just 29% of his 3-pointers at Kentucky. Has a low release point on his jumper that hinders him at times when closely contested.</p>

                <h5>ESPN Pre-Draft Analysis</h5>
                <p>Perhaps the best pure shooter in the draft, Joe made just 34% of his 3s as a sophomore but attempted an incredible 10.6 per game. He hit 41% of his 8.0 attempts as a freshman. While he slumped beyond the arc, Joe did hit 89% of his free throws as a sophomore, an encouraging sign. Joe doesn't do much else besides shoot, which helps explain his low spot in the top 100s, but given solid size and his 3-point volume, he's got a chance to be a Terrence Ross-style threat off the bench. - Pelton</p>

                <h5>ESPN Pre-Draft Analysis</h5>
                <p>Featuring the height (6-10), length (7-2 wingspan) and reach (9-1.5) of a center but the frame of a small forward (219 pounds), Reed is one of only six college players in the past decade to average 1.9 steals and 2.5 blocks per game, a sign of his defensive potential. 
                    He covers ground impressively on the perimeter and does an excellent job of protecting the rim despite weighing only 219 pounds, but he has his fair share of lapses on and off the ball and relies too heavily on his physical tools, making him less effective than his counting stats might indicate. 
                    Offensively, his trigger happy and often wild style of play was difficult to watch at times on a fairly dysfunctional team that went just 3-15 in the Big East. 
                    Teams cite concerns around his approach to the game via background intel and questionable interviews as reasons his stock never truly took off in the pre-draft process despite his status as an analytics darling, but his physical tools and defensive versatility still give him a solid chance to hear his name called on draft night. - Givony</p>
