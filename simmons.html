He played college basketball for one season with the Louisiana State University (LSU) Tigers, after which he was named a consensus first-team All-American and the USBWA National Freshman of the Year. Simmons was selected with the first overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft by the 76ers. 
                
                He is the third Melbourne-born number one overall pick (following Andrew Bogut and Kyrie Irving) in 11 years. After sitting out a year due to an injured right foot, he was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 2018. Simmons was named NBA All-Star in 2019 and 2020.
