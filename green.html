            <img src="./images/PHOTO-GREEN.jpg" class="photo-starter">
            <p>Green played college basketball for the University of North Carolina (UNC), where he played in more games (145) and had more wins (123) than any Tar Heel before him. He is also the only player in the history of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) with at least 1,000 points, 500 rebounds, 250 assists, 150 three-pointers, 150 blocks and 150 steals.

He won an NCAA championship his senior year and was subsequently drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 46th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. During the 2013 NBA Finals, Green set an NBA record for most three-point field goals made in a Finals series (23). He then won an NBA championship with the San Antonio Spurs the following season, and became just the third player from UNC to win an NCAA championship and an NBA championship, the two others being James Worthy and Michael Jordan. 

In 2019, he won a second NBA championship in his only season with the Toronto Raptors. He won a third championship in 2020 with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Known for his perimeter defense and three-point shooting, Green has been a key contributor on both ends on the floor throughout his NBA career, having been selected to his first NBA All-Defensive Second Team in the 2016â€“17 season.</p>
